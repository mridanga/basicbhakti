### Falafel Burgers

This recipe is actually a very young in its iteration cycle. I envisioned falafel burgers with the added compliment of potatoes to give the patty some moisture. Tahini acts as our binding agent, however if your patties are falling apart add some breadcrumbs to the mix. The ratios are still in the works, however here is the basic concept.

#### Ingredients
- 1 Can Chickpeas, Roughly Mashed
- 2-4 Small Potatoes Grated
- 1/4 - 1/2 Cup Pine Nuts
- 2 tbsp Tahini Paste
- 2 tbsp Lemon Juice
- 1/2 - 1 tbsp Cumin Powder
- 1/2 tbsp Paprika or Chilli Powder
- 1 Jalapeños Minced
- 1/4 tsp Hing
- 1/2 Cup Parsley Diced, Tightly Packed
- Olive Oil
- Salt & Pepper
- (Optional) 1/4 - 1/2 Cup Breadcrumbs

#### Method
1. Add everything to a mixing bowl and kneed the mixture until it makes a dough. Adding some oil to your palms will help protect them from the spices and jalapeños.
2. Form the patties into small 1/2" - 3/4" thick patties. Make them as dense as possible.
3. Put some oil in a non stick skillet over medium high heat. Pan fry the patties on each side for ~5 min until the sides are nicely browned and the patties are cooked through. Press down on the patties intermittently to help flatten them which helps insure they cook through.

### Black Bean Burgers

This is a pretty forgiving recipe. Mix and match your favorite herbs and spices, don't feel constrained to using just the ones listed bellow. The ratio I like to follow is 1 can of beans to 1+ cup of binding agents. In this, our binding is breadcrumbs, oats, and flax. You can use peanut butter, quinoa, rice, flour. Nuts and seeds give this dish a nice crunch while the oats, parsley, and carrots give visual contrast.

#### Ingredients
- 1 Can Black Beans
- 2 - 4 Carrots Shredded
- 1/2 Cup Breadcrumbs
- 1/2 Cup Oats
- 1/4 Cup (Each, Diced) Walnuts, Almonds, Sunflower Seeds (mix and match your favorite nuts / seeds)
- 2 1/2 tbsp Flax Seed Meal
- 1/2 Cup Warm Water
- 1/2 - 1 tbsp Cumin Powder
- 1/2 tbsp Paprika or Chilli Powder
- 1/4 tbsp (Each) Thyme, Oregano
- 1 Jalapeños minced
- 1/4 tsp Hing
- 1/2 Cup Parsley Diced, Tightly Packed
- Olive Oil
- Salt & Pepper
- (Optional) 2 tbsp Soy Sauce

#### Method
1. Add the flax meal to the warm water and set aside for 10 min.
2. Add all the ingredients into a mixing bowl, be sure to extract as much watter from the beans and carrots as possible. Kneed mixture until it forms a nice dough.
3. Make small patties about 1-2" - 3/4" thick.
4. **Baking**: Preheat oven to 350. Line a baking pan with foil, wipe it down with olive oil, and place patties on it. Bake 15-17 min on each side.
4. **Frying**: Over medium high heat, put olive oil in a nonstick pan. Fry the patties for 5 min on each side until they are golden brown, pressing down intermittently.

### Al Fresco Salsa

The base recipe for this al fresco salsa is very simple. Olives, mozzarella, cilantro, lemon and oil. As all of these ingredients (save for the lemon and cilantro) are a little heavy so choose your optional ingredients to be light and refreshing. Keep in mind the colors going into the salsa, white, green, and brown (depending on the olives) will make a nice contrast with red tomatoes, or yellow and orange peppers.

#### Ingredients
- 1 - 2 Cup Fresh Mozzarella Diced
- 1/2 Cup Olives Diced
- 1/2 Bunch Cilantro Diced
- 2 - 4 tbsp Olive Oil
- 2 - 4 tbsp Lemon Juice
- 1/8 tsp Hing
- Salt & Pepper
- (Optional) 1 Diced Avocados
- (Optional) 1/2 Cup Corn
- (Optional) 1 Cup (Each) Green, Yellow Pepper Diced
- (Optional) 1/2 Cup Tomato

#### Method
1. Mix all the ingredients in a bowl.
2. Heat the oil over medium heat. When hot, add the hing and sauté for a few seconds then add to the mixture.

### Tzatziki
Truly, I am not even sure if this is considered Tzatziki sauce. At it's heart, this dip is simply home made Greek yogurt with herbs and oil. Choose your herbs which would compliment your main course the most. The cucumber, lemon juice, and fresh herbs makes this a very refreshing compliment to your meal. Serve this we toasted pita bread on the side for dipping.

#### Ingredients
- 1 Tub of Plain Yogurt
- 1/2 Bunch Fresh herbs (ie. Dill or Mint) Minced
- 1 Cucumber, Peeled and Grated
- 1 - 2 tbsp Olive Oil
- 1 - 2 tbsp Lemon Juice
- 1 Ping of Hing
- Salt & Pepper

#### Method
1. The night before, suspend a sive lined with thick cheese cloth over a bowl. Scoop the yogurt into the cheese cloth and refrigerate. You can get by with letting this sit in the fridge for 2 hours.
2. Mix yogurt, salt, pepper, lemon juice, cucumber, and 3/4 of the herbs together. Spread this mixture evenly on your serving dish.
3. In a small pan, heat the oil over medium heat. When the oil gets warm (NOT hot) add a ping of hing, swirl this around for 5 seconds until the hing dissolves, then pour it on top of the yogurt.
4. Garnish with the remaining herbs and serve.

### Chickpeas in Tomato Sauce

#### Ingredients
- 1.25 cups chickpeas, soaked overnight, drained and rinsed, then cooked. They cook pretty fast in the pressure cooker. After they are butter soft but not mushy, drain them but retain some of the liquid in a separate container **OR** 2.5 cups canned and cooked chickpeas, drained
- 5 tomatoes
- Chana Masala Spice Blend (Optional, but it makes it tastier, but if not available, replace with black pepper and a squeeze of lemon)
- Coriander Powder
- Turmeric
- Red chilli powder
- Jalapeno/ Serrano peppers (2 medium or 1.5 large, finely chopped, seeded if desired)
- 1-2 inch piece ginger, peeled and grated
- Cumin seeds
- Mustard Seeds
- 10-12 Curry Leaves, very finely chopped (available in the Indian store, you can buy a couple of packets and freeze them). If these are unavailable, you can omit.
- Oil
- Some ghee
- Salt
- Cilantro for garnish if desired


#### Method
1. Chop the tomatoes very fine
2. In a pot, add some oil. Add 1-2 tsp of mustard seeds. Once they pop, add cumin seeds. The more the merrier. Maybe 1-2 Tablespoons?
3. Once they brown, add the finely chopped jalapenos, grated ginger and chopped curry leaves. Fry for 1 minute maybe.
4. Add the chopped tomatoes. Turn the heat to high until the sauce begins to thicken. Then on a medium/ medium high flame, wait for it to become very thick. Once you run out of patience, add 1 tsp or so of turmeric, a sprinkle of red chilli powder, 1-2 tsp of coriander powder and mix on moderate heat. NOW the sauce will begin to REALLY thicken.
5. At this stage, if you have chana masala powder, add. The quantity, hmmm. Maybe 1- 2 tablespoons? I actually just take the box and directly add a little from it, until the sauce begins to take on the desired color!! If you don't have this masala, add a sprinkle of black pepper now and some lemon juice once the dish is ready.
6. Cook this sauce on moderate heat for a couple of minutes. Then add the drained chickpeas. Mix. Add a little of the reserved liquid or water, add the salt and bring to a boil.
7. Once the dish has the consistency you like, add some melted ghee :)
8. Garnish with chopped cilantro if desired!
